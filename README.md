# React_ShereyeshCodingSchool

A collection of small React (Vite) practice projects used to learn core React concepts, routing, state management, context, effects, forms, localStorage, Tailwind basics, and UI composition. Each folder is a standalone Vite + React app demonstrating a focused topic.

## Quick start

- Open a terminal and change into any project folder, for example:

```bash
cd "API Calling"
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Most projects use Vite with the default scripts from `package.json` (`dev`, `build`, `preview`).

## Projects (what you'll find and learn)

- [API Calling](API Calling): Fetching data from APIs and rendering results. Key file: `src/component/Card.jsx`.
- [child_to_parent](child_to_parent): Example of passing data from child components back to parent. Key file: `src/Component/Navbar.jsx`.
- [Context_Api](Context_Api): Demonstrates React Context for theme or shared state. Key files: `src/ThemeContext/ThemeContext.jsx`, `src/ThemeContext/Nav2.jsx`, `src/ThemeContext/Button.jsx`.
- [Different_state_learning](Different_state_learning): Notes and examples for different state patterns and destructuring in React.
- [form_handling](form_handling): Form state management and basic validation examples.
- [function_understanding](function_understanding): Notes and examples about creating and using functions in React and JavaScript (learning artifacts in `.text` files).
- [localStorage](localStorage): Examples showing how to persist state using `localStorage`.
- [Note_project](Note_project): A simple notes starter app (learning exercise for state and components).
- [project_based_component](project_based_component): Component-based project with reusable `Card.jsx` component.
- [react01](react01): Beginner React examples: `Card.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx` in `src/components`.
- [Router_react_Dom](Router_react_Dom): Routing with React Router; pages like `Home`, `About`, `Product`, and `NotFound` under `src/Component/Pages`.
- [tailwind_learning](tailwind_learning): Playground for trying Tailwind CSS utilities.
- [Two_way_winding](Two_way_winding): Two-way binding / controlled components examples.
- [UI_Design](UI_Design): UI composition examples and small component library structure under `src/Component` (sections, profile, cards).
- [USEEFFECT](USEEFFECT): Examples exploring `useEffect` and lifecycle patterns.

## How this README showcases your learning

- Each project folder is a focused exercise: try running them individually to inspect the code and live behavior.
- Look at component files and the simple `.text` notes (in some folders) for explanations of concepts you practiced.
- The `Router_react_Dom` project demonstrates multi-page routing structure and how you organize routes and pages.

## Suggested next improvements

- Add a screenshot or short GIF for each project to make the README more visual.
- Add a one-line summary and key concepts learned at the top of each project folder (in that folder's own `README.md`).
- Add tests or small storybook stories for reusable components in `UI_Design` and `project_based_component`.

## Contributing / Next steps

- If you want, I can:
  - Generate per-project `README.md` files with run instructions and highlights.
  - Add badges or screenshots for each project.
  - Create a small index page listing demos with links and short descriptions.
